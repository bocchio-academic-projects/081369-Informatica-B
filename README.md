## Background

This repository is my personal archive of the projects and exercises completed for the "Informatica B" (Computer Science B) course, part of my university curriculum.
It represents a practical journey through the foundational concepts of procedural programming with C and numerical computing with MATLAB.


## Overview

The repository is organized into three main sections, each corresponding to a different aspect of the course:

- `/C`: Contains exercises focused on the C programming language.
These files explore fundamental concepts such as data structures (`struct`), enumerations (`enum`), and basic algorithms.
They are primarily small, self-contained programs designed to solve specific problems posed during the course, including exam simulations.

- `/Matlab`: A larger collection of MATLAB scripts that tackle a variety of numerical and algorithmic tasks.
The focus here is on matrix manipulation, solving mathematical equations, plotting results, and basic image generation.
Scripts range from checking for palindromic matrices to solving and graphing quadratic equations.

- `/Competition`: A special project developed in MATLAB to render the Canadian flag using matrix operations.
This was a more creative and structured task, involving a modular approach with multiple functions working together to draw, fill, and color the final image.


## Quick Start Guide

The code in this repository consists of individual scripts and programs that can be run independently.
No central application needs to be built.

To run the MATLAB scripts, simply open them in MATLAB and execute them.
To run the C programs, compile them using a C compiler (like `gcc`) and execute the resulting binary.
```bash
gcc -o program_name source_file.c
./program_name
```


Have a nice coding day,
